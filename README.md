### Overview
This project is a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge designed to demonstrate the mechanics and real-world impact of Length Extension attacks â€” a cryptographic vulnerability affecting hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1.

In this challenge, users can browse a store and attempt to purchase an item. Although their account balance isn't sufficient to complete the transaction, a flaw in the way requests are signed allows them to exploit a length extension attack to manipulate the payment data â€” ultimately enabling them to purchase items without spending any money.

Perfect for CTF participants, security researchers, or anyone curious about cryptographic flaws in practice.
